# Grest

Grest is a collection of utilities for writing Go web applications using the standard in-built [`http` package](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/).

## Rationale

Coming from the JavaScript ecosystem, one of my biggest objectives with the language was to learn how to use the language constructs and rely less on frameworks/external libraries. Go is particularly awesome as the standard packages/modules contain practically you need to easily write web applications out of the box.

> So, welcome to the neanderthal movement of relying more on inbuilt language APIs more than frameworks/libs unless necessary :smirk:
